      <description>Structure of github hosted site  All code, configs, and markup live in this repository. Then, when all of our content is ready to be published after an update, all of the static content from the configs/markup will be generated. This generated static content will be automatically be moved into the public folder, which is a submodule. public is basically like a symbolic link to the main branch of the repository that the static content is HOSTED from.</description>

      <description>As my fourth semester was just wrapping up, I was getting ready to take a few much needed weeks off before work and unwind just a little bit. Two days after my last final, however, I found out about Chia. Needless to say, I guess I never got to stop!
Fortunately for me and many other homelab and mining enthusiasts, farming Chia is a lot of fun. And by fun, I mean spending ludacris amounts of money on enterprise hardware that we would otherwise never have an excuse to buy.</description>

      <description>This is my first project!  First ordered list item Another item   Unordered sub-list.   Actual numbers don&amp;rsquo;t matter, just that it&amp;rsquo;s a number  Ordered sub-list   And another item.  ⋅⋅⋅You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces (at least one, but we&amp;rsquo;ll use three here to also align the raw Markdown).
⋅⋅⋅ To have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.</description>

      <description>As a conclusion to my computer organization course, our final project was to implement a five stage pipeline constructed in Verilog over an FPGA partially implementing the MIPS instruction set.
Abstract The following details the development of a five stage pipeline constructed on Xilinx&amp;rsquo;s Vivado in Verilog over an FPGA partially implementing the MIPS instruction set. In its current configuration, it supports only basic R-Format instructions like add, sub, and, or, etc.</description>

      <description>Each year, Penn State New Kensington holds their Research and Student Engagement Expo where Penn State students like myself get to present their research findings to faculty and other students. Despite being held virtually as a consequence of the Pandemic, all of us seemed to persevere and come through with some really interesting projects and topics. You can find the main page for all of the projects here.
As a Sophomore in the Penn State New Kensington Honors Program, this was my year to participate!</description>
