Last winter break I became obsessed with individually addressable LEDs. More specifically, I was interested in controlling them. Soon enough, I found myself lost in the world of ESP based controllers and almost sank entirely into the home-assistant/home-automation world trying to find a good controller that\nWouldn’t break the bank and That wouldn’t burn the house down I initially planned on designing and building my own controller first, but realized that I really wanted something that was trusted, well tested, and something that I can make again and again without issue. This was difficult, as there were a few big-name solutions like the sonoff controllers and even those from shelly that seemed attractive, but were either too unreasonably priced or just didn’t seem practical. Plus, I wanted to tailor these controllers exactly to the environment/configuration in which I’d be using them, and these off-the-shelf solutions just didn’t offer the transparency and customizability that I was looking for.\nEnter QuinLED Right as this search got to its most frustating point, I discovered Quindor, the creator of the quinled boards!\nQuindor designed, tested, and published the exact kind of solution I was looking for. His boards were quickly gaining traction in the LED community, he provided all kinds of updates and information on his current developments, and was always there in his Discord to get you the help you needed on a project. Plus, most of his board designs that I looked into using were electronically simple enough for someone like myself to understand enough at a high level to use flexibly.\nQuindor’s website is filled with useful information, perhaps a daunting amount, basically detailing everything and anything you’d need to know to get started using his boards and configuring your LEDs.\nMy Project Starting fresh, I decided that I would take on the task of outfitting the cubbies of my desk with some individually addressable LEDs so that I could partition the LEDs into cubes. To pull this off, I eventually settled on building the QuinLED Dig Uno, Quindor’s single-strip IALED controller (technically you can get two on there if using WS2812 LEDs, but that’s beside the point).\nWhile I’m not sure what the reccomended method is today, at the time it was still common and affordable to buy the components from his provided parts list separately, order the PCB’s from a fabricator, and then solder everything together at home. This was the route I ended up taking, as I wanted to have enough parts on hand to build a bunch of these things in case I decided to go crazy on some design (I ended up building three, of course).\nAfter even more deliberation, I also honed in on what type of addressable LEDs I wanted to use: SK6812 RGBW. These were the perfect hybrid for what I wanted. They offered the colorability and customizability of the obnoxious RGB lights that I was looking for, while also reserving the special ability to look like entirely normal ambient lighting with their dedicated warm-white channel. Next, I’d need some way of powering this whole setup. While I don’t remember the details of my calculations enough from a year ago, I honed in on this tiny little 50 Watt MEAN WELL 5V power supply. While 50 V was likely a touch overkill for this setup given the number of LEDs and their typical use, if there’s one thing they’ve driven into our head at school, it’s design for the worst case, and design with overhead. Either way, this little guy would power my setup comfortably without any risk of overheating, making annoying humming noises, or just malfunctioning in general. The last, and perhaps most stressful part in all of this part selection, was actually just becoming acquainted with all of the different hardware options out there. That is, what was the best kind of wire to use for connecting everything? Should I get special couplings, or just wire-nut everything together? Everyone has different schools of thought on these, but it was hard to get good, solid answers regarding what the best course of action was. Eventually, though, I was able to get some help on Quindor’s Discord and found some good examples by people posting their setups in there as well.\nA brief look at the build Because I’m a bit fuzzy on the details having worked on this about a year ago, I can’t quite go into the details of my design or the process, but I wanted to at least provide a high level overview of the project.\nSoldering Situation The first step was getting the Dig Uno board all soldered together. This was…interesting. The board itself was great. The problem was my soldering situation. Available to me at the time was a 30-some year old radio-shack soldering iron with tips worn to kingdom-come. While this iron had worked perfectly for every other project I’d ever worked on, I wasn’t confident at all in my ability to do SMD with it.\nIn a hurry, I started doing research on soldering stations and eventually landed on the famous KSGER station that uses T12 tips. This was and still is way more than anything I’ll ever need. However, I went with the KSGER for a few reasons:\nIt is widely supported and known. It felt like I was buying into an open source software project. Something goes wrong with it? There’s a YouTube video. Need a firmware update? Someone online has you covered. Why would I care about this for a soldering iron? It means that I can keep it running for longer. When something breaks 10 years down the road, I can fix it and keep it for longer. The ability to fine-tune soldering temperature. While this isn’t critical in most projects I work on, I have certainly run into a few situations repairing PC or phone components where excessive heat could’ve got me into trouble. I’m not saying this is even a common occurence for me, but it was a nice bonus. T12 tips. Precision temperature control, increased longevity, generally not junk. The main theme in all of this is that I wanted a soldering station that was extensible, repairable, and quality enough. Oh, and I’m mentioning all of this because it was a major blocker in my build. That was until I discovered that the KSGER wouldn’t be arriving until a month later. I did all that research and would’nt even get to use it to build these boards. Still determined, however, I set out with the radio-shack iron and somehow managed to build three boards with the decaying tip on the 30-year old iron. Hooking It All Up Finally, breezing over a fair amount of detail regarding planning, assembly, and techniques for working with the LEDs, it came time to put the pieces together and wire up the shelves. Once both shelves were all wired up, I got the power supply mounted on the back and wrapped things up. If you want to see some more of the progress, below is an IMGUR link that I posted in Quindor’s Discord when I finished. There are a few more pictures in there and it shows a few more steps from along the way.\nhttps://imgur.com/a/6JKV7mm\nI had a lot of fun with this first LED adventure, yet I still have only scratched the surface of what’s possible with these guys, let alone with home-assistant, MQTT, the ESP chips, and the whole lot. Unfortunately for my further LED and home automation endeavors, school prevails for the time being. It’s exciting to see the development that Quindor has been making over the past year, and there are lots of other great YouTuber’s out there as well who go into all kinds of detail with projects like this.\n","wordCount":"1342","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Nathan Litzinger"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://nlitz88.github.io/projects/2020leds/2020leds/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Nathan Litzinger","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://nlitz88.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://nlitz88.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)">Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://nlitz88.github.io/litzingernathanresume.pdf title=Resume><span>Resume</span></a></li><li><a href=https://nlitz88.github.io/projects title=Projects><span>Projects</span></a></li><li><a href=https://nlitz88.github.io/posts title=Posts><span>Posts</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://nlitz88.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://nlitz88.github.io/projects/>Projects</a></div><h1 class=post-title>My First QuinLED Dig Uno Project</h1><div class=post-meta>7 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;Nathan Litzinger&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/projects/2020leds/2020leds.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p><em>Note: This is more of just a retrospective post.
