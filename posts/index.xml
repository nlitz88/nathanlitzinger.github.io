      <title>Bird Detection With YOLOv7</title>

      <description>Thanks to this tutorial from TheCodingBug, I was able to use YOLOv7 to create a very primitive bird detection network. I scraped some generic Pennsylvania bird images, labelled them with a single &amp;ldquo;bird&amp;rdquo; class, and let YOLO work its magic overnight.
For only an evening&amp;rsquo;s worth of work, I am extremely happy with the results. No&amp;ndash;it&amp;rsquo;s not perfect, but it&amp;rsquo;s REALLY promising. With the amount of footage I have recorded and can potentially label in time, I have no doubt that I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to fine tune this model for our feeders and improve its recall even more.</description>

      <title>The Discrete Fourier Transform - Conceptual Overview and Practical Notes</title>

      <description>This Spring (2022), I took my first signal processing class. One of the most interesting things we covered was the Fourier Transform, and more practically, the Discrete Time Fourier Transform.
I&amp;rsquo;m posting the PDF below as a reference for later projects, mainly to serve as a conceptual reminder of some of the concepts explaining the transform and how to do it. Though its covered on the Discrete Fourier Transform, the underlying principles are roughly the same for the DTFT (which we compute using fft).</description>

      <title>Building a Bird Feeder Live Stream</title>

      <description>As my Spring 2021 semester was nearing completion, I found myself looking for ways to &amp;ldquo;productively procrastinate&amp;rdquo; studying for finals. Like many others at the time, COVID had led my family to resurrect our bird feeders as another at-home distraction. While it was fun seeing all kinds of new birds emerge from our woods, I soon found myself in a predicament: I couldn&amp;rsquo;t see the birds for the majority of the day.</description>

      <title>My Chia Mine - Plotting With 10K SAS Drives</title>

      <description>As my fourth semester was just wrapping up, I was getting ready to take a few much needed weeks off before work and unwind just a little bit. Two days after my last final, however, I found out about Chia. Needless to say, I guess I never got to stop!
Fortunately for me and many other homelab and mining enthusiasts, farming Chia is a lot of fun. And by fun, I mean spending ludacris amounts of money on enterprise hardware that we would otherwise never have an excuse to buy.</description>

      <title>Penn State New Kensington Research Expo - Blockchain Technology</title>

      <description>Each year, Penn State New Kensington holds their Research and Student Engagement Expo where Penn State students like myself get to present their research findings to faculty and other students. Despite being held virtually as a consequence of the Pandemic, all of us seemed to persevere and come through with some really interesting projects and topics. You can find the main page for all of the projects here.
As a Sophomore in the Penn State New Kensington Honors Program, this was my year to participate!</description>
